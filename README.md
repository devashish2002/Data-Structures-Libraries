# Stacks
Stack is an abstract data type with a bounded(predefined) capacity. It is a simple data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a particular order. Every time an element is added, it goes on the top of the stack, the only element that can be removed is the element that was at the top of the stack, just like a pile of objects.

# Queues
Queue is also an abstract data type or a linear data structure, in which the first element is inserted from one end called REAR(also called tail), and the deletion of existing element takes place from the other end called as FRONT(also called head). This makes queue as FIFO(First in First Out) data structure, which means that element inserted first will also be removed first.
